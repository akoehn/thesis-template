A template for theses
=====================

This LaTeX code comes from 
[my dissertation](https://ediss.sub.uni-hamburg.de/volltexte/2020/10455/pdf/Dissertation.pdf)
and I like the style, so I make it available for adoption.  Use
everything in here freely as you want, pick & choose.

This code is based on LuaTeX and biblatex, which makes everything so
much nicer to use (proper font support! unicode support! easy
customization of bibliography styles!).

You need to run `lualatex` to compile the tex files and `biber` to
generate the bibliography.

The bibliography style slightly differs from my dissertation and is
more in line with the ACL style.
